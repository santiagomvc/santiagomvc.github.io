    "Base language models are aligned to predict the next token in a sequence of words, trained over most of the public internet text corpus. Since we want LMs to be more helpful than a simple autocomplete, we use Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align the LMs objective to generate helpful responses to users. This does not mean that LM will behave like humans in all cases. In some cases humans can be very unhelpful, as anyone calling customer support can attest. \n",

    "Still, in some cases (like testing a web page shopping experience) it can be useful to have a LM behave like a human. In this case we will focus in a simple case of decision making under risk, where humans usually behave in an irrational behavior, not always present in the language model responses."
